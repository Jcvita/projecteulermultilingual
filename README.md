<h1>Project Euler </h1> 
<p>
<a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a website where users can share math challenges that require the help of a computer to solve. Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics.

I am working on using these math problems to improve my programming skills of various different languages and will be keeping a repository of the scripts created to solve these problems here. Please do not use these scripts to cheat on any of the math problems on Project Euler. 

Please do not ruin the answers for yourself unless you have already solved them or you're trying to hire me and need a demonstration of my programming abilities.
